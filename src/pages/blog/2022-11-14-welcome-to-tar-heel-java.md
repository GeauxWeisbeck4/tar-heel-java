# Y﻿our Favorite Coffee Supplier & Web Developer

T﻿o say Tar Heel Java is unique is an understatement - but I like to be unique. Standing out is our thing. You'll want to stand out as well with your coffee brand because there are so many different competitors out there, vying for your customer's attention. If you don't stand out with your web site and marketing, I guarantee the competition will get the majority of the market share. You don't want that and I don't want that.

I﻿'m Andrew and I've been developing websites for about five years and also  drinking coffee since I was very young - probably about 8 or 9 years old. I know my way around the game and decided to get in on it with my own brand. I thought it would be fun to expand my web dev and marketing business and combine it with my favorite drink to serve all the awesome coffee brands out there.

D﻿on't worry - I'm not necessarily trying to steal your competition. I'd rather customers buy your coffee than mine. I have a brand more so because it's something I've wanted to do for a long time. Yes, it has good marketing - but if you hire me, your website and brand will get the same quality of web design and marketing. Well better actually.

M﻿y focus is on my clients. I focus on making your online business better through web development, marketing, and business strategies that I have learned over the last decade of being an entrepreneur. Let's just say I prefer to create websites and ads to doing all the difficult work of owning a coffee shop, managing high inventory levels, or all that stuff that you have to deal with on a daily basis. 

C﻿ontact me for a free consultation and website review so I can tell you how I can make your business better - you won't regret it. I'd love nothing more than to tell the world about another awesome coffee brand that I get to work with and add another great client to my list.
